Solution:=

To fix the issue by Enabling the 64-bit processes for Enhanced Protected Mode in IE11 options security section. 

This is the steps I completed:

For 64 bit WebDriver:

Open IE

Go to Internet Options → Advanced → Security

Check ☑ Enable 64-bit processes for Enhanced Protected Mode

Click Apply and OK

For 32 bit WebDriver:

Open IE

Go to Internet Options → Advanced → Security

Uncheck ☐ Enable 64-bit processes for Enhanced Protected Mode

Click Apply and OK

IE Security level settings:

It needs to set same Security level in all zones. To do that follow the steps below

Open IE

Go to Tools -> Internet Options -> Security

Set all zones (Internet, Local intranet, Trusted sites, Restricted sites) to the same protected mode, enabled or disabled should not matter.

Finally, set Zoom level to 100% by right clicking on the gear located at the top right corner and enabling the status-bar.

Default zoom level is now displayed at the lower right.
